# "Bunnies on Borders" - the game

Based on [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/ "PixiJS") web game.
The only thing you need to do is to drag bunnies on Poland's borders.

This is my **personal reaction to "Rasary to borders" initiative** - meetings organized by polish catholc church where attendees are reciting the rosary to protect Poland from refugee invasion.
If you are like me feel free to clone this repo and play with *Bunnies on Borders* or re-create this game and show others there are another better ways to fight against fear.
